Hello! My name is Maple and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Washington's Applied Mathematics masters program. Currently seeking work in the data science field. This is my personal website that will showcase relevant data science projects along with other miscellanous projects I am currently working on. 

This personal website is currently a work in progress.
